# Travel-guide-for-travelling-29-states-in-india-through-flight-bus-or-car
This is travel guide created using Dijkstra's algorithm and is coded in c++. 

The problem is to generate a route using the existing data which we will store in form of graphs. The vertices represent the each city that we choose. We cannot consider every city. So we considered 29 cities from 29 states. We have prepared graphs in such a way that each graph contains data of different aspects that we have to consider for generating the paths.
